It's the last goodbye I swear
I can't rely on a dime a day love that don't go anywhere

I learn to cry for someone else
I can't get by on an odds and ends love that don't ever match up
I heard all you said and I took it to heart

I won't forget I swear
I have no regrets for the past is behind me
Tomorrow reminds me just where
